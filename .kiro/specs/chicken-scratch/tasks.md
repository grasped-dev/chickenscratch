# Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All tasks have been successfully implemented. The Chicken Scratch application is fully functional with comprehensive testing, CI/CD pipeline, and production-ready features.

### Post-Implementation Fixes Applied:
- ✅ **API Import Issue Resolution**: Fixed incorrect import paths in frontend services (`api` → `apiClient`)
- ✅ **Service Completeness**: Added missing frontend services (authService, uploadService, ocrService, exportService, summaryService, jobService)
- ✅ **Type Import Consistency**: Updated shared type imports to use relative paths instead of package names
