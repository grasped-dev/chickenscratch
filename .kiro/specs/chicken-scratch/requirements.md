# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Chicken Scratch is an application that transforms physical notes and scribbles into actionable digital insights. Users can capture photos of sticky notes, whiteboards, chart paper, index cards, or notebook pages from classrooms, professional development sessions, or meetings, and the system will automatically extract text, organize content semantically, and provide summarized insights that can be easily shared and exported.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educator or meeting facilitator, I want to upload images of handwritten and printed notes from multiple sources, so that I can digitize physical content for analysis and sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a camera interface for capturing images
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL provide file upload functionality for image selection
3. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC)
4. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file size and format before processing
5. IF an image fails validation THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with mixed handwritten and printed content, I want the system to extract all text accurately, so that no information is lost during digitization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image contains handwritten text THEN the system SHALL use AWS Textract to extract the text content
2. WHEN an image contains printed text THEN the system SHALL use AWS Textract to extract the text content
3. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for extracted text
4. WHEN extraction confidence is low THEN the system SHALL flag uncertain text for user review
5. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL preserve spatial relationships and note boundaries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working with complex layouts, I want the system to automatically detect individual note regions, so that separate ideas are properly isolated and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL automatically detect bounding boxes around individual notes
2. WHEN bounding boxes are detected THEN the system SHALL group related text within each boundary
3. WHEN automatic detection is insufficient THEN the system SHALL allow manual adjustment of bounding boxes
4. WHEN a user manually adjusts boundaries THEN the system SHALL update text groupings accordingly
5. WHEN multiple notes overlap THEN the system SHALL attempt to separate them into distinct regions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user receiving extracted text, I want the content to be clean and normalized, so that it's readable and consistent for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL remove OCR artifacts and noise
2. WHEN text contains spelling errors from OCR THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction
3. WHEN text formatting is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL normalize spacing and punctuation
4. WHEN abbreviations are detected THEN the system SHALL preserve them while ensuring readability
5. WHEN text cleaning is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain original meaning and context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user analyzing multiple notes, I want related content to be automatically grouped together, so that I can identify common themes and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaned text is available THEN the system SHALL perform semantic clustering using embeddings or LLM analysis
2. WHEN clustering is performed THEN the system SHALL group notes with similar meaning or topics
3. WHEN clusters are formed THEN the system SHALL ensure each note belongs to the most appropriate cluster
4. WHEN clustering is complete THEN the system SHALL provide cluster confidence scores
5. IF clustering produces unclear results THEN the system SHALL allow manual cluster reassignment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user reviewing clustered content, I want each theme to have a descriptive label, so that I can quickly understand what each group represents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clusters are formed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate descriptive theme labels
2. WHEN theme labels are generated THEN the system SHALL make them concise and meaningful
3. WHEN a user views theme labels THEN the system SHALL allow manual editing of labels
4. WHEN labels are edited THEN the system SHALL save the custom labels for future reference
5. WHEN multiple similar themes exist THEN the system SHALL ensure labels are distinct and clear

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user seeking insights from my notes, I want a comprehensive summary that highlights key themes and patterns, so that I can quickly understand the main takeaways.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clustering and labeling is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary digest
2. WHEN creating the digest THEN the system SHALL identify the top themes by frequency and importance
3. WHEN presenting themes THEN the system SHALL include representative quotes from each cluster
4. WHEN showing distribution THEN the system SHALL provide percentage breakdown of theme prevalence
5. WHEN the digest is complete THEN the system SHALL present insights in a clear, scannable format

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user who needs to share insights with others, I want to export my results in standard formats, so that I can distribute findings through various channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests export THEN the system SHALL provide PDF format option
2. WHEN a user requests export THEN the system SHALL provide CSV format option
3. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the system SHALL include summary, themes, and representative content
4. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL structure data for analysis in spreadsheet applications
5. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download confirmation and file access

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a regular user of the application, I want to access my previous projects and captures, so that I can reference past insights and track progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a capture session THEN the system SHALL save the project to history
2. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a list of past projects
3. WHEN viewing project history THEN the system SHALL show project date, title, and summary information
4. WHEN a user selects a past project THEN the system SHALL restore the full analysis and results
5. WHEN managing history THEN the system SHALL allow users to delete or rename past projects
